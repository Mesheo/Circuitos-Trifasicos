### *Dash is an amazing framework for building ML and DataScience web apps*.

<p>In this project, I learned very important concepts from Next.js, like Server Side Rendering, Static Site Generation, API Routes, integration with Stripe, an internet payment infrastructure, webhooks with Stripe, data persistence in FaunaDB, a non-relational database focused on serverless, authentication with GitHub using Next Auth and best practices in css using Sass.
